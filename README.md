# ACTransmitter
A Transmitter which i made for playing Assetto Corsa and driving my RoboSoccer Robots (can be used with roboracers and sumobots too). it uses an esp32 to connect 2x joysticks and 4x buttons to the pc and send serial data to vjoyserialfeeder to emulate a dinput controller, and uses espnow for transmitting rc signals
